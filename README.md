# Bomberperson

An online multiplayer game similar to its famous predecessors such as [Bomberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman). 

This repo contains both the client and the server code written in
C++20 (I use many cool features introduced in that standard). Checkout
the generic **(de)serialisation** implemented in the `marshal.h` file,
quite cool I think.

Written as a part of a university course for the University of Warsaw.
